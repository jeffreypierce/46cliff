## Playing Music


### Play Music on Kitchen HomePods
The easiest way to play music in the kitchen is to ask Siri. While Siri can play music by artist, song, or album, she is most likely to understand you if you ask in the format _Album Title_ by _Artist Name_ or _Mix_ by _Artist or Style_. 

For Example:
> _“Hey Siri, play Tragedy and Geometry by Steve Hauschildt“_  
> _“Hey Siri, play a Mix by The Carpenters”_   

### Play Music from your Phone or Computer 
You can stream music from your phone to multiple speakers directly out of iTunes. Once you start playing a track,  press the AirPlay button and you will be presented with a list of available speakers:
- Family Room Speakers (Joey Roth Ceramic speakers)
- Living Room Speakers (Black Yamaha with Bose speakers)
- Kitchen (HomePods)
- Family Room TV (Samsung Sound Bar)
- Otto’s TV (Otto’s TV)

### Stream to Different Devices
To stream to one or more devices, you need to: 
1. Ensure the desired speakers are on 
2. Select the correct input on those speaker’s amplifier 
3. Check the box next to the name of the speaker (or speakers) in iTunes 
4. Control the volume from your phone _and_ the speakers themselves

The best way to get the volume balanced is to set each device to the _highest_ volume you might want with your phone’s volume also at max.  Then, use your phone’s volume to turn down from max to the desired amount and to control the slight changes while you listen.

**Family Room Speakers**
- Turn system on  by pressing the button on the white power supply at the back right of the record player stand 
- Turn knob on black input selector (on record stand shelf) to  `WH`  (for whole house)
- Control the volume with two large silver knobs; one for the _speakers_ (on record stand shelf) and one for the _sub-woofer_ on the sub-woofer itself. Use the right knob on the subwoofer for volume as the other is a frequency crossover control. If you don’t know what that is, don’t change it. It takes a bit of patience to find a good balance between the tweeters and the woofers.

**Living Room Speakers**
- Press the power button or use the remote to turn on the amp 
- Press the power button on the sub-woofer (typically it is left on)
- Turn the input selector on the receiver to  `Line 1`
- Use the big black knob on the amp to set the volume

**Kitchen**
- Always on - no need to power up
- Control the volume by touching the top of the HomePod, `+` and `-`
- The two HomePods are linked as a stereo pair, meaning changing the volume level on either will change them both
	
**Family Room TV**
- Turn on the TV
- Select the Apple TV input 
- Control the volume like you would for television (Samsung remote)

**Otto’s Room TV**
- Targetable, but not currently set up to receive music streams

**Alison’s Studio**
- Available in the new year

### Playing Records

**Family Room Turntable**
- Turn system on  by pressing the button on the white power supply at the back right of the record player stand 
- Turn knob on black input selector (on record stand shelf) to  `TT`  (for turntable)
- Put a record on the platter
- Hold down the button on record player until the light by _33_ stops flashing.
- Press button again to select _45s_
- Move tone arm over record and lower with lever
- Control the volume with two large silver knobs; one for the _speakers_ (on record stand shelf) and one for the _sub-woofer_ on the subwoofer itself. Use the right knob on the sub-woofer for volume as the other is a frequency crossover control. If you don’t know what that is, don’t change it. It takes a bit of patience to find a good balance between the tweeters and the woofers.
-  _N.B._ The turntable preamp is much louder than the streaming music preamp - so you will likely be turning volume lower

**Sun Room Turntable**
- Out for repair, instructions coming soon

**Multi-room Record Streaming**
- Coming Soon (and it’s going to be complicated) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Smart Home Controls


### Wink and Home apps
Our smart home uses two protocols to allow control; Wink and HomeKit by Apple. Protocol is just a fancy way to say the language the devices use to communicate.  Any lightbulb, lock, thermostat, etc... gets connected to the Wink Hub (in internet closet shelf) and it makes it available for control in the wink app. Additionally, i have a little piece of software running (on the NAS server) that translates the protocols into Apple’s language so we can also use the Home app and Siri to control the smart devices. Because not everything can be perfectly translated, there are some devices in Wink that do not show up in the Home app.

While the Wink app is organized by device type and the Home app is organized by room, they work similarly; find the device you want to control and long press it until it shows its available actions. Additionally, you can schedule actions to happen based on a variety of input actions with Robots.

### Relays
In addition to apps, our home has two Relays, Wink command centers that attach to the wall. These run a modified version of the wink app allowing for control of the entire house. The two buttons on the Relay are used to execute any commands in the house with physical buttons. They also are equipped with an intercom to communicate between them. As you approach the Relay the screen will come on showing some quick commands. To get to the full list of controllable devices, swipe down from the top.

### Siri Control
Since our devices are translated into the HomeKit protocol, we can use Siri to command most of our smart home. The key thing to remember is to call what the different devices are named in the Home app. You can either call, “Hey Siri” to the HomePods or use the Siri button on your phone. There are five main avenues to take when controlling the house with Siri:

**Turn accessories on or off**
From lights to appliances, Siri can turn your HomeKit accessories on or off. 
For Example:
> _"Turn on the Back Hallway lights."_  
> _"Turn off the Living Room fan."_  

**Adjust an accessory**
Siri can adjust some HomeKit accessories, like lights or a thermostat.
For Example: 
> _"Set the temperature in the Living Room to 68 degrees."_  
> _"Adjust the brightness of the Globes to 50%."_  
> _"Turn the living room lights all the way up."_  
> _"Make the lights blue in the Family Room."_  

**Control a room or zone**
Since we organize our accessories by room, we can control areas of your house with a single command.
For Example:
> _"Turn off the lights downstairs."_  
> _"Turn on the fan in the kitchen."_  
> _"Start heating the upstairs."_  

**Set a scene with Siri**
Scenes let us control multiple accessories at the same time. There are no scenes currently set up but over time we will include commands like:
> _"Hey Siri, good night."_  
> _"Hey Siri, I'm home."_  
> _"Hey Siri, set my reading scene."_  

**Check our home's status**
In bed and want to know if we left the lights on downstairs? Siri knows:
> _"Did I leave the lights on downstairs?"_  
> _"Is my garage door open?"_  
> _"What's the Bedroom thermostat set to?"_  

**Control our accessories remotely**
We can ask Siri to control our home when away. 
> _"Turn off the lights in our Vermont house."_  
> _"Turn on the fan in the Family room."_  
> _"Set the Vermont house to 72 degrees."_  

### Ring Doorbell and apps
Our front doorbell (and back door later in the new year) is equipped with a video camera and motion detector.  While the Wink app can access its functionality, because of the complexity of video streaming, it is best to use the native Ring app. That said, you can still use triggers from the doorbell (motion sensing, rings) to control other connected devices.
